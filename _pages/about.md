As a Technical Lead with nearly a decade of experience in software engineering, I specialize in building resilient, scalable, and high-performing systems for trading and financial services. My journey has taken me from hands-on coding to leading cross-functional teams, where I’ve tackled complex infrastructure challenges and driven innovation at the intersection of finance and tech.

I’m driven by a passion for solving complex problems and continuously learning new technologies. My approach combines strategic thinking with a hands-on mindset, ensuring that solutions are both practical and scalable. Currently, I’m exploring new challenges where I can bring my expertise to help companies build robust, efficient, and scalable systems.
