Check out my old meetup talk from Kyiv Elixir Meetup. 
I introduced GraphQL as a powerful alternative to REST APIs, emphasizing its ability to fetch only necessary data, thus improving efficiency, while explaining how GraphQL simplifies data aggregation from multiple sources, a complex task in REST.  Also, I gave some practical examples, how GraphQL's type system and schema contribute to cleaner code and faster development.
